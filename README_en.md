# OCGoQuota Android

OCGoQuota Android is a local usage dashboard for OpenCode Go, built with Tauri 2, Rust, SQLite, and React.

This project is adapted from [evanfu0110/68hub](https://github.com/evanfu0110/68hub/). OCGoQuota is Android-only and adds a local Rust core, encrypted Cookie storage, touch pull-to-refresh, and an Android APK release pipeline. Many thanks to Evan Fu for the original open-source project and foundation!

## Features

- Quota and usage statistics for multiple OpenCode Go accounts
- Token rankings, daily trends, and usage records
- Touch-friendly Android layout with pull-to-refresh
- Device-local data with no cloud backend or localhost service
- Rust + SQLite local core with an Android-specific TLS configuration
- Chinese and English interfaces

## Development

You need Node.js, pnpm, Rust, Android Studio/SDK, Java 17, and the Android NDK.

```bash
pnpm install

# Android device or emulator development
pnpm dev
```

## Build an APK

```bash
pnpm tauri android init
pnpm build:android
```

The default build targets an Android arm64 APK. The release workflow is in `.github/workflows/release.yml` and requires Android signing Secrets.
